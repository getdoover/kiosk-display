"""Work out what this device wants on its panel, from the config it already has.

A widget app makes itself a kiosk by naming `kiosk_display` in its `depends_on`.
The platform then creates a kiosk install alongside it — but with nothing in its
config, because a dependent install is created bare. Rather than ask the widget
app to fill that in, the kiosk reads the device's `deployment_config` aggregate
and finds the app that pulled it in.

The aggregate holds every install on the device under `applications`, keyed by
install name, and the platform stamps `dv_widget_url` into an entry only when
that application ships a widget. That flag is the whole detection rule: no
declaration, no convention, nothing to keep in sync in the widget's repo.

The page itself is served by the device agent, not the cloud — `dv_widget_url`
is also the name of the channel the DDA serves the bundle from. A widget on the
panel is a local page, so there is no login for a device with no keyboard to
get past.
